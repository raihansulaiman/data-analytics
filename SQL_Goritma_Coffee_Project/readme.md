Defining Business Process

1. SUPPLYING COFFEE PROCESS

Goritma coffee has its own supplier of roasted coffee beans, namely Javanica Coffee and Roastery, which is located on Jalan BKR, Bandung. Due to Goritma Coffee's quota which is still relatively small and is still at the beginning of its career, which is open on January 8, 2020, the raw material procurement system is still directly carried out by Goritma coffee employees who will contact the supplier and they themselves take the coffee beans to the supplier. But if Javanica coffee and Roastery cannot fulfill the order for raw materials when needed, Goritma Coffee will take another alternative by looking for raw materials from other suppliers but only temporarily due to differences in the quality of roastery coffee beans from other suppliers with Javanica even though there are only a few difference.

2. ORDERING COFFEE PROCESS
 
The way to order orders at Goritma Coffee is that the customer goes directly to the cashier then selects the desired order then the cashier will input the order using an application called 'cashier' and the application automatically stores customer order data. After the order has been inputted, the cashier will process the payment then after the customer has finished paying, the order will be processed. When the order is processed, the customer is invited to sit and wait for the order. Then after the order is completed, the order will be delivered directly by the employee to the customer's seat. 

The recap of payments at Goritma Coffee has been automatically carried out by this 'cashier' application. Recap data in the form of expenses, what has been sold, and what products were ordered by customers the most in that month.
